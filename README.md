# Dental-Odontogenic-Lesion CBCT and Histopathology Integrated Dataset (DOLCHID)

This repository provides the official documentation, metadata, and access instructions for the **DOLCHID** dataset — the first curated multi-modal dataset integrating **Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT)** imaging and corresponding **histopathology (H&E-stained)** slices for odontogenic lesion research.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> Due to the inclusion of human clinical imaging and diagnostic data, the raw CBCT and histopathology images are **not stored in this repository**. Access is granted via a controlled-access mechanism hosted on figshare (see below).

## 📘 Dataset Overview

DOLCHID includes paired CBCT volumes and histopathological images collected from confirmed odontogenic lesion cases.  
Four major lesion subtypes are included:

- **Ameloblastoma (AME)**
- **Dentigerous Cyst (DC)**
- **Radicular Cyst (RC)**
- **Odontogenic Keratocyst (KCOT)**

Each case includes:

- CBCT imaging data  
- H&E-stained histopathology slides  
- Expert-verified lesion subtype labels  
- Segmentation annotations (where applicable)

This dataset supports tasks such as:

- Lesion segmentation (CBCT and histopathology)
- Single-modal lesion classification
- Multi-modal fusion and cross-modal learning
